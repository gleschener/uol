novel about it  devops  and helping your business win     kevin behr  george spafford  gene kim    uma narrativa sobre a introdução de devops em uma empresa fícticia  que em certos momentos farão você cogitar a possibilidade do gene kim ser um espião trabalhando ao seu lado devido as grandes semelhanças com  qualquer empresa de ti  será impossível não se identificar de forma assustadora com os personagens do livro e dar pequenos sorrisos ao encontrar versões  da vida real  dos mesmos   the devops handbook  how to create world class agility  reliability  and security in technology organizations     gene kim  jez humble  patrick debois  and john willis    está com a sensação de que o projeto unicórnio do phoenix project é pura ficcão  não sabe como colocar o  three ways  em prática ou por onde começar  este livro vai te ajudar a entender devops e ilustrar o case de grandes organizações completamente transformadas ou impulsionadas por devops  lean  agile  tps e etc    citações       in devops  we typically define our technology value stream as the process required to convert a business hypothesis into a technology enabled service that delivers value to the customer      agile often serves as an effective enabler of devops  because of its focus on small teams continually delivering high quality code to customers      devops isn t about automation  just as astronomy isn t about telescopes      because value is created only when our services are running in production  we must ensure that we are not only delivering fast flow  but that our deployments can also be performed without causing chaos and disruptions such as service outages  service impairments  or security or compliance failures      instead of a culture of fear  we have a high trust  collaborative culture  where people are rewarded for taking risks     release it   design and deploy production ready software     michael t nygard    porque a amazon não fica indisponível na black friday e meu site não fica em pé com um aumento de    na carga por causa de um cupom novo  qual o custo dessa indisponibilidade para a minha empresa  como reverter essa situação  porque a distância entre  feature complete  e  production ready  é tão grande  se você  não  estiver familiarizado com os termos  inversão de sla    circuit breaker    zero downtime deployments    falhas em cascata    bulkheads    unbalanced capacities    unbounded result sets   leia este livro agora    citações       first  you need to accept that fact that despite your best laid plans  bad things will still happen second  realize that  release    is not the end of the development project but the beginning of the system s life on its own      software design today resembles automobile design in the early   s  disconnected from the real world      systems spend much more of their life in operation than in development at least  the ones that don t get canceled or scrapped do      don t avoid one time development expenses at the cost of recurring operational expenses      team assignments are the first draft of the architecture  see  conway s law   it s a terrible irony that these very early decisions are also the least informed      denying the inevitability of failures robs you of your power to control and contain them     continuous delivery  reliable software releases through build  test  and deployment automation     jez humble  david farley    todas as funcionalidades foram implementadas  mas ainda serão necessárias semanas ou meses para seu software ser entregue como manter meu software sempre pronto para produção  quais práticas utilizar  quais não utilizar  quais os benefícios  embutir qualidade no processo de desenvolvimento e antecipar riscos é potencialmente o melhor investimento a ser feito no seu software     citações       a working software application can be usefully decomposed into four components  executable code  configuration  host environment  and data      configuration management refers to the process by which all artifacts relevant to your project  and the relationships between them  are stored  retrieved  uniquely identified  and modified      in software  when something is painful  the way to reduce the pain is to do it more frequently  not less      it should always be cheaper to create a new environment than to repair an old one      the repeatability and reliability derive from two principles  automate almost everything  and keep everything you need to build  deploy  test  and release your application in version control     site reliability engineering  how google runs production systems     betsy beyer  chris jones  jennifer petoff  niall richard murphy    coletanêa de artigos do time de sre do google  ilustrando a origem do termo  cultura  princípios e práticas internas  da formação de time até valiosas lições de como potencializar o feedback de sistemas em produção para o desenvolvimento  e sem deixar de lado conceitos como gerenciamento de mudança  monitoramento  planejamento de capacidade e resposta a incidentes    citações       software engineering has this in common with having children  the labor before the birth is painful and difficult  but the labor after the birth is where you actually spend most of your effort      sre is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team      one could equivalently view sre as a specific implementation of devops with some idiosyncratic extensions      the most relevant metric in evaluating the effectiveness of emergency response is how quickly the response team can bring the system back to health  that is  the mttr      notas     disponível gratuitamente  online  https   landing google com sre book index html    review completo por

kalkarsak c   shell php scriptidir bazen virüs olarak kabül edinmekte bazense hack aracı olarak bilinmektedir yüklenilen c   shellde yeşil yanıyorsa perm vardır yani yazma silme gibi izin vardır anlamına gelmekte eğerki c   shellde perm yoksa şöyle hack yoluna başvurabiliriz wp confing php  wordpress  configuration php  joomla  gibi confing dosyasını okuyup yukardaki sql bölümünden veritabanına bağlanıp database düzenlemesi yapabilirsiniz yada admin kullanıcı adı şifresi değiştirebilirsiniz wordpresslerde genellikle wp userde kullanıcı adı ve şifreleri bulunmakta fakat şifreler genellike md lidir ama bunun içni siz yeni md  oluşturup değiştirebilirsiniz fakat baştada söylediğimzi gibi bu özel c   shellde buna gerek bile kalmıycak permleri özel olarak yeşil yapıp işlem

rahat uyguluyabilirsiniz komut işlemleri diğer c   shell gibidir  var named komutu sunucudaki siteleri listeler var user ise sunucudaki kullanıcı isimlerini gösterir home user public html komutuyla ise sunucudaki bir sitenin içine rahat bir şekilde girebilirsiniz bu özel shelli arap hacker tarafından kodlanıp piyasaya sürülmüştür genel başta     satılmaya başlamıştır fakat sonradan bedava sürümü verilmeye başlamıştır c   web shell herkes tarafından bilinen piyasada olan ilk shelldir     sitesinde hackerler tarfından kullanılmaya başlanmıştır şuan     piyasında kullanılan bu shell genellikle wordpress ve joomla upload açıklarında deneniyor c   shell tanımını yapmaya kalkarsak c   shell php scriptidir bazen virüs olarak kabül edinmekte bazense hack aracı olarak bilinmektedir yüklenilen c   shellde yeşil yanıyorsa perm vardır yani yazma silme gibi izin vardır anlamına gelmekte eğerki c   shellde perm yoksa şöyle hack yoluna başvurabiliriz wp confing php  wordpress  configuration php  joomla  gibi confing dosyasını okuyup yukardaki sql bölümünden veritabanına bağlanıp database düzenlemesi yapabilirsiniz yada admin kullanıcı adı şifresi değiştirebilirsiniz wordpresslerde genellikle wp userde kullanıcı adı ve şifreleri bulunmakta fakat şifreler genellike md lidir ama bunun içni siz yeni md  oluşturup değiştirebilirsiniz fakat baştada söylediğimzi gibi bu özel c   shellde buna gerek bile kalmıycak permleri özel olarak yeşil yapıp işlem yapmanızı sağlıyor shellimize girdiğimizde en alt sağ kısımda upload etme seçeneğinide sizlere sunuyor bazense root yapma imkanı sunucudaki siteleri hepsine index atma gibi bir özelliğide sunuyor bazı c   shellerde genellikle antivürsler  hack  olarak algıladığı için virüs olarak görüyor bu yüzden anti virüs kapatmayı deneyin yoksa

shared state  mutable data   pure functions   don t mutate any state or data  back to question            a name  a                class inheritance    instances inherit from classes  like a blueprint  a description of the class   and create sub class relationships  hierarchical class taxonomies instances are typically instantiated via constructor functions with the   new   keyword class inheritance may or may not use the   class   keyword from es    prototypal inheritance    instances inherit directly from other objects instances are typically instantiated via factory functions or   object create     instances may be composed from many different objects  allowing for easy selective inheritance    composition    your object contains another object  called its prototype  and    delegation    when you access a property on your object  if it s not directly defined on it  javascript will search the prototype chain and delegate that behavior to the first object it finds that defines that property  back to question               a name  a                oop pros    it s easy to understand the basic concept of objects and easy to interpret the meaning of method calls oop tends to use an imperative style rather than a declarative style  which reads like a straight forward set of instructions for the computer to follow   oop cons    oop typically depends on shared state objects and behaviors are typically tacked together on the same entity  which may be accessed at random by any number of functions with non deterministic order  which may lead to undesirable behavior such as race conditions   fp pros    using the functional paradigm  programmers avoid any shared state or side effects  which eliminates bugs caused by multiple functions competing for the same resources with features such as the availability of point free style  aka tacit programming   functions tend to be radically simplified and easily recomposed for more generally reusable code compared to oop   fp cons    over exploitation of fp features such as point free style and large compositions can potentially reduce readability because the resulting code is often more abstractly specified  more terse  and less concrete  back to question               a name  a              this is a trick question the answer is never i ve been issuing this challenge for years  and the only answers i ve ever heard fall into one of several  common misconceptions  https   medium com javascript scene common misconceptions about inheritance in javascript d d bab  b a  more frequently  the challenge is met with silence  back to question              a name  a              this is a quote from   design patterns  elements of reusable object oriented software   http   www amazon com design patterns elements reusable object oriented dp             it means that code reuse should be achieved by assembling smaller units of functionality into new objects instead of inheriting from classes and creating object taxonomies in other words  use   can do  has a    or   uses a   relationships instead of   is a   relationships  back to question               a name  a              two way data binding means that ui fields are bound to model data dynamically such that when a ui field changes  the model data changes with it and vice versa one way data flow means that the model is the single source of truth changes in the ui trigger messages that signal user intent to the model  or  store  in react  only the model has the access to change the app s state the effect is that data always flows in a single direction  which makes it easier to understand one way data flows are deterministic  whereas two way binding can cause side effects which are harder to follow and understand   good to hear     react is the new canonical example of one way data flow  so mentions of react are a good signal cycle js is another popular implementation of uni directional data flow  angular is a popular framework which uses two way binding  back to question                a name  a              a monolithic architecture means that your app is written as one cohesive unit of code whose components are designed to work together  sharing the same memory space and resources a microservice architecture means that your app is made up of lots of smaller  independent applications capable of running in their own memory space and scaling independently from each other across potentially many separate machines   monolithic pros    the major advantage of the monolithic architecture is that most apps typically have a large number of cross cutting concerns  such as logging  rate limiting  and security features such audit trails and dos protection when everything is running through the same app  it s easy to hook up components to those cross cutting concerns there can also be performance advantages  since shared memory access is faster than inter process communication  ipc    monolithic cons    monolithic app services tend to get tightly coupled and entangled as the application evolves  making it difficult to isolate services for purposes such as independent scaling or code maintainability monolithic architectures are also much harder to understand  because there may be dependencies  side effects  and magic which are not obvious when you re looking at a particular service or controller   microservice pros    microservice architectures are typically better organized  since each microservice has a very specific job  and is not concerned with the jobs of other components decoupled services are also easier to recompose and reconfigure to serve the purposes of different apps  for example  serving both the web clients and public api  they can also have performance advantages depending on how they re organized because it s possible to isolate hot services and scale them independent of the rest of the app   microservice cons    as you re building a new microservice architecture  you re likely to discover lots of cross cutting concerns that you did not anticipate at design time a monolithic app could establish shared magic helpers or middleware to handle such cross cutting concerns without much effort in a microservice architecture  you ll either need to incur the overhead of separate modules for each cross cutting concern  or encapsulate cross cutting concerns in another service layer that all traffic gets routed through eventually  even monolthic architectures tend to route traffic through an outer service layer for cross cutting concerns  but with a monolithic architecture  it s possible to delay the cost of that work until the project is much more mature microservices are frequently deployed on their own virtual machines or containers  causing a proliferation of vm wrangling work these tasks are frequently automated with container fleet management tools  back to question              a name  a              synchronous programming means that  barring conditionals and function calls  code is executed sequentially from top to bottom  blocking on long running tasks such as network requests and disk i o asynchronous programming means that the engine runs in an event loop when a blocking operation is needed  the request is started  and the code keeps running without blocking for the result when the response is ready  an interrupt is fired  which causes an event handler to be run  where the control flow continues in this way  a single program thread can handle many concurrent operations   user interfaces are asynchronous by nature    and spend most of their time waiting for user input to interrupt the event loop and trigger event handlers node is asynchronous by default  meaning that the server works in much the same way  waiting in a loop for a network request  and accepting more incoming requests while the first one is being handled this is important in javascript  because it is a very natural fit for user interface code  and very beneficial to performance on the server  back to question             a name  a                hoisting is javascript s default behavior of moving declarations to the top in javascript  a variable can be declared after it has been used in other words  a variable can be used before it has been declared   example    gives the same result as   example       example        javascript x      assign  to x elem  document getelementbyid  demo      find an element elem innerhtml  x    display x in the element var x    declare x      example        javascript var x

choose from the sheer amount of choices is fantastic  but this also infamously presents a difficulty when components are mixed and matched and it doesn t take too long for budding developers to find out that not all components are built to play nicely together to address these issues  the competing module specs amd and commonjs have appeared on the scene  allowing developers to write their code in an agreed upon sandboxed and modularized way  so as not to  pollute the ecosystem    asynchronous module definition  amd    has gained traction on the frontend  with requirejs being the most

             iife is a function that executes immediately after it s created it has nothing to do with any event handler for any events  such as  document onload   the first pair of parentheses   function       turns the code within  in this case  a function  into an expression  and the second pair of parentheses   function         calls the function that results from that evaluated expression this pattern is often used when trying to avoid polluting the global namespace  because all the variables used inside the iife  like in any other  normal  function  are not visible outside its scope this is why  maybe  you confused this construction with an event handler for  window onload   because it s often used as this     javascript  function      all your code here var foo  function      window onload  foo           foo is unreachable here  it s undefined     the function is executed right after it s created  not after it is parsed the entire script block is parsed before any code in

ajax is the use of javascript to send and receive using http without reloading the page   ajax   is an acronym for   asynchronous javascript and xml    and is used as a technique for creating client side asynchronous web applications ajax is considered a group of technologies html and css can be used in combination to mark up and style information javascript and the xmlhttprequest object provide the method for exchanging data asynchronously between the browser and the server      how does ajax work  ajax  sends and retrieves data from a server asynchronously this enables the web application to continue running and dynamically display it allows the user to interact with the information presented on the page  avoiding full page reloads the image below shows the process the execution of ajax  a user interaction in the browser triggers the event  such as a button click  the ajax call fires this creates and ajax request  browsers use the xmlhttprequest object when the server responds to the browser s request  the same xmlhttprequest object will process the result  the server side script receives the input from javascript  and processes the data  after the data is processed  the script sends the data back to the original client side page that made the request via xml  once the data is received  a second javascript callback function  is called this function captures the data  and updates the web page accordingly   advantages   ajax provides more efficient and smoother running applications  which gives users better interactive experiences the best use of ajax is where it is used to send small payloads here is a simple example i load a page that contains information about stock it has graphs  charts  company information and it also displays the share price every   seconds  i make an ajax request that gets the updated share price and changes it on the page without ajax  i might decide to refresh the entire page every   seconds  but with ajax  i can just make a lightweight request to get the tiny bit of information i need   disadvantages   using ajax to submit forms isn t always the best bet asides from not really giving you a clear advantage over posting the form normally  you break conventions such as browser history  although some browsers now include javascript  states  as pages in the history  when using ajax  you need to handle the task of telling the user if something has gone wrong you can do this with jquery by specifying what should happen on error  but many people forget to do this and the end user is blissfully unaware of any problem other issues to watch out for are any javascript errors that may prevent your events from firing  or if javascript is disabled  in either case ensuring that the form can submit normally before you add the ajax code is the safest option  more information  http   stackoverflow com questions         what are the advantages and disadvantages of making ajax calls using jquery   back to question

you change its behaviour changing the behaviour of an object that will only be used by your own code is fine but when you change the behaviour of something that is also used by other code there is a risk you will break that other code when it comes adding methods to the object and array classes in javascript  the risk of breaking something is very high  due to how javascript works long years of experience have taught me that this kind of stuff causes all kinds of terrible bugs in javascript if you need custom behaviour  it is far better to define your own class  perhaps a subclass  instead of changing a native one that way you will not break anything at all the ability to change how a class works without subclassing it is an important feature of any good programming language  but it is one that must be used rarely and with caution  back to question                   typeof  a name  a              in javascript     null    is also considered an object therefore  the code below surprises javascript newcomers    javascript var bar  null  console log typeof bar     object      logs true    as long as one is aware of this  the problem can easily be avoided by also checking if bar is null      javascript console log  bar    null     typeof bar     object       logs false     to be entirely thorough in our answer  there are two other things worth noting  first  the above solution will return false if bar is a function in most cases  this is the desired behavior  but in situations where you want to also return true for functions  you could amend the above solution to be     javascript console log  bar    null      typeof bar     object      typeof bar     function         second  the above solution will return true if bar is an array  e g  if var bar      in most cases  this is the desired behavior  since arrays are indeed objects  but in situations where you want to also false for arrays  you could amend the above solution to be     javascript console log

 this special value results from an operation that could not be performed either because one of the operands was non numeric  e g    abc       or because the result of the operation is non numeric  e g  an attempt to divide by zero  while this seems straightforward enough  there are a couple of somewhat surprising characteristics of  nan  that can result in hair pulling bugs if one is not aware of them for one thing  although  nan  means  not a number   its type is  believe it or not   number      javascript console log typeof nan     number      logs  true     additionally   nan  compared to anything  even itself   is false     javascript console log nan    nan     logs  false     a  semi reliable  way to test whether a number is equal to nan is with the built in function  isnan     but even using   isnan    is an imperfect solution  https   developer mozilla org en us docs web javascript reference global objects isnan confusing special case behavior  a better solution would either be to use  value    value   which would  only  produce true if the value is equal to nan also  es  offers a new   number isnan     https   developer mozilla org en us docs web javascript reference

the following to the console     javascript                    nan   nan    here s why  the fundamental issue here is that javascript  ecmascript  is a loosely typed language and it performs automatic type conversion on values to accommodate the operation being performed let s see how this plays out with each of the above examples   example                  outputs             explanation    the first operation to be performed in        since one of the operands        is a string  javascript assumes it needs to perform string concatenation and therefore converts the type of    to              yields       then            yields          example                   outputs            explanation    based on order of operations  the first operation to be performed is        the extra    before the first      is treated as a unary operator  thus  javascript converts the type of      to numeric and then applies the unary    sign to it  i e  treats it as a positive number  as a result  the next operation is now      which of course yields    but then  we have an operation between a number and a string  i e     and        so once again javascript converts the type of the numeric value to a string and performs string concatenation  yielding         example                   outputs            explanation    the explanation here is identical to the prior example  except the unary operator is    rather than    so      becomes     which then becomes     when the    is applied  which is then added to    yielding     which is then converted to a string and concatenated with the final      operand  yielding         example                     outputs             explanation    although the first      operand is typecast to a numeric value based on the unary    operator that precedes it  it is then immediately converted back to a string when it is concatenated with the second      operand  which is then concatenated with the final      operand  yielding the string          example       a    b         outputs      nan      explanation    since the    operator can not be applied to strings  and since neither   a   nor   b   can be converted to numeric values    a    b   yields  nan  which is then concatenated with the string      to yield  nan     example       a    b       outputs     nan    explanation    as exlained in the previous example    a    b   yields  nan  but any operator applied to nan with any other numeric operand will still yield  nan   back to question                a name  a              the difference is scoping  var  is scoped to the

not accessible before they are declared in their enclosing block      global  they are very similar when used like this outside a function block    javascript let me   go     globally scoped var i

is an increasingly common practice  employed by many popular javascript libraries  jquery  node js  etc  this technique creates a closure around the entire contents of the file which  perhaps most

to question                       error handling  a name  a              the short and most important answer here is that  use strict  is a way to voluntarily enforce stricter parsing and error handling on your javascript code at runtime code errors that would otherwise have been ignored or would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions in general  it is a good practice some of the key benefits of strict mode include     makes debugging easier   code errors that would otherwise have been ignored or would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions  alerting you sooner to problems in your code and directing you more quickly to their source    prevents accidental globals   without strict mode  assigning a value to an undeclared variable automatically creates a global variable with that name this is one of the most common errors in javascript in strict mode  attempting to do so throws an error    eliminates this coercion   without strict mode  a reference to a  this  value of null or undefined is automatically coerced to the global this can cause many headfakes and pull out your hair kind of bugs in strict mode  referencing a a  this  value of null or undefined throws an error    disallows duplicate property names or parameter values   strict mode throws an error when it detects a duplicate named property in an object  e g   var object   foo   bar   foo   baz      or a duplicate named argument for a function  e g   function foo val   val   val        thereby catching what is almost certainly a bug in your code that you might otherwise have wasted lots of time tracking down    makes eval   safer   there are some differences in the way  eval    behaves in strict mode and in non strict mode most significantly  in strict mode  variables and functions declared inside of an  eval    statement are  not  created in the containing scope  they  are  created in the containing scope in non strict mode  which can also be a common source of problems     throws error on invalid usage of delete   the  delete  operator  used to remove properties from objects  cannot be used on non configurable properties of the object non strict code will fail silently when an attempt is made to delete a non configurable property  whereas strict mode will throw an error in such a case  back to question               a name  a              surprisingly  these two functions will  not  return the same thing rather     javascript console log  foo  returns     console log foo      console log  foo  returns     console log foo         will yield     javascript foo  returns  object  bar   hello   foo  returns  undefined    not only is this surprising  but what makes this particularly gnarly is that  foo     returns undefined without any error being thrown the reason for this has to do with the fact that semicolons are technically optional in javascript  although omitting them is generally really bad form  as a result  when the line containing the  return  statement  with nothing else on the line  is encountered in  foo      a semicolon is automatically inserted immediately after the return statement no error is thrown since the remainder of the code is perfectly valid  even though it doesn t ever get invoked or do anything  it is simply an unused code block that defines a property  bar  which is equal to the string   hello    this behavior also argues for following the convention of placing an opening curly brace at the end of a line in javascript  rather than on the beginning of a new line as shown here  this becomes more than just a stylistic preference in javascript  back to question               a name  a              the potential stack overflow can be avoided by modifying the  nextlistitem  function as follows     javascript var list  readhugelist    var nextlistitem  function    var item  list pop    if  item     process the list item settimeout  nextlistitem           the stack overflow is eliminated because the event loop handles the recursion  not the call stack when  nextlistitem  runs  if  item  is not null  the timeout function   nextlistitem   is pushed to the event queue and the function exits  thereby leaving the call stack clear when the event queue runs its timed out event  the next  item  is processed and a timer is set to again invoke  nextlistitem  accordingly  the method is processed from start to finish without a direct recursive call  so the call stack remains clear  regardless of the number of iterations  back to question                  numbers  a name  a              an educated answer to this question would simply be   you can t be sure it might print out     and  true   or it might not numbers in javascript are all treated with floating point precision  and as such  may not always yield the expected results  the example provided above is classic case that demonstrates this issue surprisingly  it will print out     javascript                   false     back to question                a name  a              this may sound trivial and  in fact  it is trivial with ecmascript  which introduces a new  number isinteger    function for precisely this purpose however  prior to ecmascript   this is a bit more complicated  since no equivalent of the  number isinteger    method is provided the issue is that  in the ecmascript specification  integers only exist conceptually  i e  numeric values are  always  stored as floating point values with that in mind  the  simplest and cleanest  pre ecmascript   solution  which is also sufficiently robust to return  false  even if a non numeric value such as a string or  null  is passed to the function  would be the following     javascript function isinteger x   return  x       x      the following solution would also work  although not as elegant as the one above     javascript function isinteger x   return math round x     x      note that  math ceil    or  math floor    could be used equally well  instead of  math round     in the above implementation or alternatively     javascript function isinteger x   return  typeof x     number      x             one fairly common   incorrect   solution is the following     javascript function isinteger x   return parseint x        x      while this  parseint  based approach will work well for  many  values of  x   once  x  becomes quite large  it will fail to work properly the problem is that  parseint    coerces its first parameter to a string before parsing digits therefore  once the number becomes sufficiently large  its string representation will be presented in exponential form  e g    e      accordingly   parseint    will then try to parse   e      but will stop parsing when it reaches the  e  character and will therefore return a value of    observe     javascript  string                           e      parseint                              parseint                                                     false     back to question                   events and runtime  a name  a              the values will be logged in the following order     javascript        let s first explain the parts of this that are presumably more obvious      and    are displayed first since they are logged by simple calls to  console log    without any delay     is displayed after    because    is being logged after a delay of     msecs  i e   second  whereas    is being logged after a delay of  msecs ok  fine but if    is being logged after a delay of  msecs  doesn t that mean that it is being logged right away  and  if so  shouldn t it be logged  before      since    is being logged by a later line of code  the answer has to do with properly understanding  javascript events and timing  http   javascript info tutorial events and timing depth  the browser has an event loop which checks the event queue and processes pending events for example  if an event happens in the background  e g  a script  onload  event  while the browser is busy  e g  processing an  onclick    the event gets appended to the queue when the onclick handler is complete  the queue is checked and the event is then handled  e g  the  onload  script is executed  similarly   settimeout    also puts execution of its referenced function into the event queue if the browser is busy when a value of zero is passed as the second argument to  settimeout     it attempts to execute the specified function  as soon as possible  specifically  execution of the function is placed on the event queue to occur on the next timer tick note  though  that this is  not  immediate  the function is not executed until the next tick that s why in the above example  the call to  console log     occurs before the call to  console log      since the call to  console log     is invoked via settimeout  so it is slightly delayed   back to question               a name  a              dom elements can be nested inside each other and somehow  the handler of the parent works even if you click on it s child the reason is  event bubbling  for example  the following  div  handler runs even if you click a nested tag like  em  or  code      html  div onclick  alert  div handler worked       em click here triggers on nested  code em  code   not on  code div  code   em    div            bubbling   the main principle of bubbling states    after an event triggers on the deepest possible element  it then triggers on parents in nesting order        stopping the bubbling the bubbling goes right to the top when an event occurs on an element  it will bubble up to   html    triggering handlers on it s way but a handler may decide that event is fully processed and stop the bubbling  for w c compliant browsers   event stoppropagation     for ie     event cancelbubble  true       capturing in all browsers  except ie    there are two stages of event processing the event first goes down  that s called  capturing   and then  bubbles  up this behavior is standartized in w c specification      summary  events first are  captured  down to deepest target  then  bubble  up in ie   they only bubble  all handlers work on  bubbling  stage excepts  addeventlistener  with last argument  true   which is the only way to catch the event on capturing stage  bubbling capturing can be stopped by  event cancelbubble true   ie  or  event stoppropagation    for other browsers  back to question                   functions  a name  a              there are  at least  two ways to do this    method       javascript function sum x   if  arguments length      return arguments     arguments      else  return function y   return x  y         in javascript  functions provide access to an  arguments  object which provides access to the actual arguments passed to a function this enables us to use the  length  property to determine at runtime the number of arguments passed to the function if two arguments are passed  we simply add them together and return otherwise  we assume it was called in the form  sum         so we return an anonymous function that adds together the argument passed to  sum     in this case   and the argument passed to the anonymous function  in this case     method       javascript function sum x  y   if  y    undefined   return x  y   else  return function y   return x  y         when a function is invoked  javascript does not require the number of arguments to match the number of arguments in the function definition if the number of arguments passed exceeds the number of arguments in the function definition  the excess arguments will simply be ignored on the other hand  if the number of arguments passed is less than the number of arguments in the function definition  the missing arguments will have a value of  undefined  when referenced within the function so  in the above example  by simply checking if the  nd argument is undefined  we can determine which way the function was invoked and proceed accordingly  back to question                  a name  a              the code will output the value of   factorial  i e      or           here s why  the named function  f    calls itself recursively  until it gets down to calling  f     which simply returns    here  therefore  is what this does     javascript f     returns n  which is  f     returns   f     which is  f     returns   f     which is  f     returns   f     which is   f     returns   f     which is    f     returns   f     which is    f     returns   f     which is     f     returns   f     which is      f     returns   f     which is       f      returns    f     which is            back to question             a name  a                 function person       declares a function  but does not execute it

            a name  a              the difference is that  apply  lets you invoke the function with  arguments  as an array   call requires the parameters be listed explicitly a useful mnemonic is  a

question             a name  a              a traditional script tag will block the page while it is loading and executing a script loaded with document write will work asynchronously that s why you see this on ads or analytics  as such scripts don t influence the page content directly  back to question                  reference  a name  a              the logged output will be     javascript  array   length   last j o n e s   array   length   last j o n e s      arr   and  arr   are the same after the above code is executed for the following reasons   calling an array object s  reverse    method doesn t only  return  the array in reverse order  it also reverses the order of the array  itself   i e  in this case   arr     the  reverse    method returns a reference to the array itself  i e  in this case   arr    as a result   arr   is simply a reference to  rather than a copy of   arr   therefore  when anything is done to  arr    i e  when we invoke  arr  push arr        arr   will be affected as well since  arr   and  arr   are simply references to the same object and a couple of side points here that can sometimes trip someone up in answering this question   passing an array to the  push    method of another array pushes that  entire  array as a  single  element onto the end of the array as a result  the statement  arr  push arr     adds  arr   in its entirety as a single element to the end of  arr    i e  it does  not  concatenate the two arrays  that s what the  concat    method is for   like python  javascript honors negative subscripts in calls to array methods like  slice    as a way of referencing elements at the end of the array  e g  a subscript of   indicates the last element in the array  and so on  back to question                  comparison and logical operators  a name  a              the code will output the following four lines     javascript                            in javascript  both     and     are logical operators that return the first fully determined  logical value  when evaluated from left to right   the or     operator   in an expression of the form  x  y    x  is first evaluated and interpreted as a boolean value if this boolean value is  true   then  true     is returned and  y  is not evaluated  since the  or  condition has already been satisfied if this boolean value is  false   though  we still don t know if  x  y  is true or false until we evaluate  y   and interpret it as a boolean value as well accordingly        evaluates to true     as does         the and     operator   in an expression of the form  x  y    x  is first evaluated and interpreted as a boolean value if this boolean value is  false   then  false     is returned and  y  is not evaluated  since the  and  condition has already failed if this boolean value is  true   though  we still don t know if  x  y  is true or false until we evaluate  y   and interpret it as a boolean value as well however  the interesting thing with the     operator is that when an expression is evaluated as  true   then the expression itself is returned this is fine  since it counts as  true  in logical expressions  but also can be used to return that value when you care to do so this explains why  somewhat surprisingly        returns   whereas you might it expect it to return  true  or      back to question               a name  a              the code will output     javascript true false    in javascript  there are two sets of equality operators the triple equal operator      behaves like any traditional equality operator would  evaluates to true if the two expressions on either of its sides have the same type and the same value the double equal operator  however  tries to coerce the values before comparing them it is therefore generally good practice to use the      rather than     the same holds true for      vs      back to question                      objects  a name  a              the output of this code will be        not        the reason for this is as follows  when setting an object property  javascript will implicitly   stringify   the parameter value in this case  since  b  and  c  are both objects  they will  both  be converted to    object object    as a result   a b   and a c   are both equivalent to  a   object object     and can be used interchangeably therefore  setting or referencing  a c   is precisely the same as setting or referencing  a b    back to question              a name  a              this is somewhat of a trick question since  in javascript  objects essentially are hashtables  i e
